###### Course-Chat-App

## Purpose 🎯
Usually all college based courses use either a personal chatting app like (whatsapp/telegram) for communication or a platform like canvas for the same.
The issue with whatsapp is that it kind of invades the private life of people involved as it is primarily a personal chatting app while the issue with canvas remains ease of usage and accessibility.

## Solution 💡 
Like various organizations develop their own slack channels for communication, we believe a standard and exclusive chat app can solve the above mentioned issues. 

## Tech Stack 🛠️
The app is primarily made on flutter , using an online postrgres based opensource databased, Supabase
